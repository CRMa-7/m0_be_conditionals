# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- A conditional is useful in code when your program needs to make a decision. They allow your code to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- If am being honest, I took this assignment slow and really tried to engage with what the questions were asking me, talking it through in technical terms to the best of my ability. I honestly think it would be fun to do this challenge again with a partner to see if they had different solutions or ways they problem solved.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- I took a very methodical and slow approach today and knew ahead of time I was not going to get it all on the first try. I had all the resources I needed at hand and problem solved my way around the challenges.
